  <h3> About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hello, I’m Jonathan Wisth am a graphic designer based out of Milwaukee in southern Wisconsin. I live and design from there with my wife and two dogs. A lot of different experiences have lead me to this field and I’m so happy to be here where I
    need to be.

    I went through school on the fast track toward engineering. Math and science looked to be my strong suit and I was always told that those fields were best for success, money, happiness. So what did I do? I shunned that concept and became a
    teacher. I thought it would be an outlet for my creative side and a chance to really feel fulfilled by making a difference. I was wrong. I felt shoehorned into a system that forced the way I had to teach and forced students to learn for the sake
    of passing tests. I just felt unaccomplished, rundown, and bored. So when I made that tough decision and left the teaching field I knew that I needed something that would fuel my diverse mindset. Something that would let me exercise precision and
    problem solving, and still let me create and explore, all the while providing something beneficial to people. Well, you can see where that landed me.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I finally realized why I‘ve always struggled on what I should be doing with my life. I’ve always beens torn between dualities. My creative side looking for free expression and my logic side, keeping me absolutely grounded in reality and the
    necessary tasks in front of me. As a result, logical work was unfulfilling and felt like a daily slog and creative work left me feeling unaccomplished and lacking direction. I finally landed here, the balance between art and necessity, creativity
    and practicality, and I couldn’t be happier to be here.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This concept of duality is the basis of my thought process when it come to design. I want to build something that looks great but also serves a purpose and is incredibly functional. Each design that I tackle is a problem that needs to be solved,
    a problem with many answers and its my job to find the best one using my creative layouts. Each design is carefully thought to ensure that it sends a clear message to its target audience and is aesthetically pleasing. I’m ready to put all of this
    to work and design for you. Hope to hear from you soon.
  </p>
  <br />
